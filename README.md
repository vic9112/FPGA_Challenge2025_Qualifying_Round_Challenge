# üöÄ FPGA Challenge 2025 - Qualifying Round

Welcome to the **FPGA Challenge 2025 Qualifying Round**!  
This competition challenges participants to optimize machine learning models for FPGA deployment using **hls4ml**.  
Your goal is to design efficient models that **maximize accuracy** while **minimizing latency** under FPGA resource constraints.

## üìö Benchmark Background

This challenge focuses on the **image classification** task using the **CIFAR-10** dataset, based on the MLPerf TinyML Benchmark using hls4ml.

It is adapted from the following reference:

> *Borras, Hendrik, et al. "Open-source FPGA-ML codesign for the MLPerf Tiny Benchmark." arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.11791 (2022)*

## üßÆ Scoring Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following three components:

1. **Accuracy: 60%**  
   - Evaluated using the same **synthetic CIFAR-10 test set** as the Kaggle competition
   - Accuracy is measured using the **C simulation results of the HLS model**

2. **Resource Utilization Constraints**  
   - Measured using results from **Vivado Logic Synthesis** (not C-Synthesis)  
   - All four key FPGA resources must remain **below 75% utilization**:
     - LUTs  
     - DSPs  
     - Flip-Flops (FFs)  
     - Block RAMs (BRAMs)  
   - The 75% threshold ensures a sufficient margin for successful **Place-and-Route** in potential downstream FPGA implementation

3. **Latency: 33.33ms (30 FPS)**  
   - Measured using **RTL simulation**  
   - Computed by taking the **average cycle count** from 5 inference samples,  
     then multiplying by the **estimated clock period** reported in the **HLS C-Synthesis** output

> To be eligible for final scoring, your HLS model must satisfy both the **resource constraint** and provide a valid **RTL latency measurement**.
